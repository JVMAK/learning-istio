### 介绍

http://maistra.io/

https://github.com/Maistra



Maistra, built around Istio, integrates with Prometheus and Jaeger to give DevOps teams visibility into issues, SecOps teams the ability to secure communication between pods using mutual TLS, and QA and development teams the ability to use canaries, traffic management, and other functionality to test products. All with very little, if any required code changes.
